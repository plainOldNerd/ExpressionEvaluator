#Expression Evaluator
This program validates an expression parsed from expressions.txt. The output of the program will either be the evaluation of the expression if the expression is valid, or a reason for its rejection. 

For readability, expressions.txt should be viewed in WordPad if using Windows, and not TextPad.  It was created on the RMIT coreteaching servers, and TextPad will not render the newline characters correctly.
Similarly for COSC2123-2109279U-A2.c.
